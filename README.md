WashU Hackathon October 14-15 2023
Hackers: Veda Bhalla and Bhakti Malhotra
A platform for users to recommend local St. Louis restaurants for their friends and create a wishlist of restaurants they want to try based on suggestions. Think Pinterest/Goodreads but for local restaurants so WashU students can support the community!
